## ðŸ“‰ Shortcomings  
While the MyCalendar application is useful and functional, there are some areas that can be improved:  
- **UI/UX Limitations**:
  - The application is not responsive right now.
  - The current design could be better - the tables and listing of comapanies can be done better.
  - The calendar view lacks advanced customization options.  
- **Error Handling**:
  - There are no toasts right now for errors or success messages. 
  - Error messages in the frontend are not always descriptive enough for debugging or end-user guidance.  
- **Authentication**:  
  - The authentication mechanism at the moment just uses the check of password entered at login.
  - It does not yet use JWT auth or some other form of authentication.
- **Notifications**:  
  - Notifications are static and do not support real-time updates or email/SMS integrations.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements  


  - **UI/UX Enhancements** :   
     - Improve responsiveness for mobile and tablet devices.
     - Have the website resigned.

  - **Advanced Authentication** : 
     - Implement JWT auth with access tokens and refersh token stores in cookies.
     - Signin from google etc. can be useful.

  - **Performance Optimizations** :
      - Optimize database queries using indexing and aggregation pipelines.  
     - Use caching mechanisms like Redis for frequently accessed data.  

  - **Accessibility Improvements** :
    - Enhance ARIA roles and keyboard navigation to make the app more accessible.

By addressing these shortcomings and implementing the suggested improvements, MyCalendar can evolve into a more feature-rich, scalable, and user-friendly application.
